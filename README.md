# Mech105
Compilation of Matlab codes for mech 105 from Colorado State University
# MachineEpsilon1
Finds the machine Epsilon of matlab by deviding a number until it equals 0 and storring the previous 
number
# MatLab_HW_10
Is a simple root finding method using built in matlab functions and a four loop to find a reactions
equilibrium
# MatLab_HW_2
Creates plots of a function showing the relationship of q(charge of a circuit) vs. time depending on  
Capacitance, Inductance, and Resistance
# MatLab_HW_3
This is a program that based on a pre-determined tank size and shape returns the volume of water in the tank
given the height of that water. This is done using methods of calculus 2.
# MatLab_HW_8
This function creates the taylor series of an inputed function from the user. It also makes foward,
backward, and centered aproximations for the derivative of that function.
# Simpson
a function that uses the simpsons 1/3 rule to integrate experimental data. The data must be evenly spaced on the independent 
variable
# Simpsontest
a script designed to easily call and test the simpson function with experimental data and compare that to the 
trapz function
# days
function that returns the day of the year, given the month, day of that month, and if it is a leap year or not
# falsePosition
Is a function that uses the false position method to find the roots of a inputed function also excepts error,
bounds to find the root, and max iterations
# luFactor
A function that completes LU factorization(with pivots) given any square matrix. Returns L, U, and identity matrix
# specialarray
creates a special array where the first row and first colomn simply count up; the horizontals and the
colomns below those are simply the sum of what is above or to the side of them.
